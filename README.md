# Automated Teller Machine ATM (my first coding project)
For our team project, we will be creating an object class called AutomatedTellerMachine. Our program will allow customer to complete transaction without the aid of a bank representative. Those who have a debit or credit card will be able to call the object AutomatedTellerMachine from the AtmData class. This object program will be useful because it will speed up the transactions process between banks and their customers. The following is our
take and thought process of implementing Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in the Java language program.
